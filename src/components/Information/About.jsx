          <h2>
            I live in the Bay Area and I am pursuing a degree in Computer
            Science at Virginia Tech. As of right now, I am learning how to code
            in React, and learning various topics through bootcamps. Regarding
            actualt projects that I have done, those can be seen by clicking on
            the little computer icon. Outside of Computer Science, I spend much
            of my time either at the gym or doing anything with friends, ranging
            from gaming to grabbing food to sports.
